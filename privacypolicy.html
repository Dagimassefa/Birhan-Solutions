    </h3>

    <p>

      In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal
      reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to
      provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to

      <u><span>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.
        </span></u>
      <br><br>
      The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on
      in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your
      personal information:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal

      </li>

        Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our
        legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend
        our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
      </li>
      <li>
        Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital
        interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the
        safety of any person.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <u><span>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.
      </span></u>
    <br><br>

    personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied
    consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click here to learn more.
    In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without
    your consent, including, for example:
    <ul>
      <li>
        If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
      </li>
      <li>
        For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
      </li>
      <li>
        For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
      </li>
      <li>

        insurance claim
      </li>
      <li>
        For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin

        If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
      </li>
      <li>
        If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the
        accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of
        an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
      </li>
      <li>
        If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to
        the production of records
      </li>
      <li>
        If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the
        collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced

        If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes

      <br><br>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
      anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been

      <br><br>
      We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to
      protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
      secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
      guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
      unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
      modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
      personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a
      secure environment.

    <h3 id="privPol10" style="text-align: center;"> 10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES. </h3>

    <p>

      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
      feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
      browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
      implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
      other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
      tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
      version of this privacy notice.

    You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we
    will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law,
    such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance

    <u>Right to be informed — Request to know

    <u>Verification process</u>
    <br><br>
    Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom
    we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so
    that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of
    request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide
    with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or
    email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances
    dictate.
    <br><br>
    We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the
    request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of
    verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
    request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
    fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
    you.

      <li>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</li>

        restrict the processing of the information.</li>

        from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your
        behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
      </li>
      <li>You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving
